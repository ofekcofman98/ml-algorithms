Linear & Polynomial Regression

main1: 
Simple Regression (Custom CSV)
Implemented a basic LinearRegression class using the normal equation.

Tested on a custom dataset: simple_regression.csv.

Printed the learned weights and model score (RÂ²).

main2:
California Housing Dataset
Used the same linear regression class.

Applied it to the fetch_california_housing() dataset from scikit-learn.

Trained and evaluated the model, and printed the results.

main3: 
Polynomial Regression (Students on Mars)
Used PolynomialFeatures to expand features into polynomial terms (degrees 1 to 4).

Trained the model on Students_on_Mars.csv.

Chose the best polynomial degree based on score.

Plotted score vs. degree for comparison.
